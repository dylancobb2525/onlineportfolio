# Personal Portfolio

## DISCLAIMER
This portfolio is based on a forked repository. The original animations and foundation of this portfolio were created by another developer. All rights and credit for the original codebase go to the original creator. I have modified and personalized the portfolio for my own use with their framework as a starting point.

The original anime.js animation library used in this project can be found here: [anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime) by Julian Garnier.
